Classification Report:
Precision: 77% (No Rain), 72% (Rain)
Recall: 71% (No Rain), 78% (Rain)
F1-score: 74% (No Rain), 75% (Rain)
Observations:
The model shows a balanced performance in predicting both rain and no rain cases.
Precision and recall are relatively close, indicating a good trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
Further improvements can be achieved using feature engineering, SMOTE for class balancing, and hyperparameter tuning.
